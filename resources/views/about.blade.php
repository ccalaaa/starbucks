                Back home in our tasting room, we take these amazing coffees and mix them with 
                beans from other regions. That’s how we create some of our most famous blends, 
                like Starbucks® Pike Place Roast. We love all of these single-origin coffees and blends. 
                More than that, we love to share our passion. So each day we feature one of these 
                outstanding brewed coffees for you to enjoy.
